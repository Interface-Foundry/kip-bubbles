  "readme": "# Angular Architecture Graph\n\nThis project is a node utility that analyses an angular project and exports a graph with the project's architecture: modules, controllers, directives and filters.\n\n[ ![Codeship Status for lucalanca/angular-modules-graph](https://www.codeship.io/projects/43e2f770-0ead-0132-1978-5ad6f07ad273/status)](https://www.codeship.io/projects/32481)\n\n## How to use it:\n\n1. Require the module:\n\n  ```js\n  var angularArchitectureGraph = require('angular-architecture-graph'),\n  ])\n  ```\n\n2. Call it with your project code:\n\n  ```js\n  var architecture = angularArchitectureGraph([\n    { id: 'file1.js', text: '<angular code here in a string>' },\n    { id: 'file2.js', text: '<angular code here in a string>' }\n  ])\n  ```\n\nIt was designed with grunt in mind. Use it with [grunt-angular-modules-graph](https://github.com/lucalanca/grunt-angular-modules-graph).\n\n3. Do whatever you want with the resulted architecture object\n\n## About\n\nThis project was originally forked from , extracted from [@carlo-colombo's](https://github.com/carlo-colombo) [angular-modules-graph](https://github.com/carlo-colombo/angular-modules-graph)\n\n## License:\nMIT\n",
